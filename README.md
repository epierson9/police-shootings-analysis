#Police shootings analysis

Analysis underlying <a href = http://www.obsessionwithregression.blogspot.com>this piece</a>.

<a href = clean_analysis.ipynb>clean_analysis.ipynb</a> contains the main analysis as well as the links for the data sources. (I do not include the Guardian and Washington Post data in the folder because I'm not sure they'd want that.) To map the Guardian data to zipcodes, see <a href = getZipsForGuardianData.py>getZipsForGuardianData.py</a>.
